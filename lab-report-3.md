# Lab Report 3 - Norman Lee

## Part 1 - Bugs

* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

```
 @Test
  public void testReversedInput() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3, 2, 1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

```
@Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

* The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

Failure-inducing input:

Input that doesn't induce a failure:

![nonFail](lab3ss1.png)

* The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

Before:
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

After:
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

The fix changes 'arr' to 'newArray' in the for loop so that it adds the elements in 'arr' into 'newArray' in reversed order and returns the 'newArray'.


## Part 2 - Researching Commands

grep -r

Example 1:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -r "acute coronary syndrome " ./technical/biomed
./technical/biomed/1471-2121-3-11.txt:        anticoagulant [ 1 ] , acute coronary syndrome [ 4 ] ,
./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt:        initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two
./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt:        when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will
./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt:        acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo,

```

Example 2:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -r "acute coronary syndrome " ./technical/911report
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % 
```

The -r option searches every file recursively in a directory and it is useful for finding a given string in a large database or large number of files.


grep -i

Example 1:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -i "imagination" ./technical/911report/chapter-11.txt
            We believe the 9/11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures: in imagination, policy,

Example 2:

The -i option ignores case-sensitivity and is useful for finding a given string without worrying about the case. It is useful for finding strings with various cases. 

grep -o

Example 1:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -o "imagination" ./technical/911report/chapter-11.txt
imagination
imagination
imagination
imagination
imagination
```

Example 2:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -o "Example" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-4.txt
Example
Example
Example
Example
Example

```

The -o option only outputs the given string and is useful for isolating certain information.

grep -l

Example 1:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -l "9/11" ./technical/911report/*
./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-10.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-11.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-12.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-13.2.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-13.3.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-2.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-3.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-5.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-6.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-7.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-8.txt
./technical/911report/chapter-9.txt
./technical/911report/preface.txt
```

Example 2:
```
normanlee@Normans-MBP docsearch % grep -l "acute coronary" ./technical/biomed/*
./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt
./technical/biomed/1471-2121-3-11.txt
./technical/biomed/1472-6963-3-12.txt
./technical/biomed/1475-2891-2-1.txt
./technical/biomed/cvm-2-4-180.txt
./technical/biomed/cvm-2-4-187.txt
./technical/biomed/cvm-2-6-286.txt
```

The -l option outputs the files that have the given string, which is useful for finding files that contain the string.
